1.  Only store phase functions on the interval (0,\pi/2) and use two
phase functions for evaluation?  This will improve accuracy near the point pi.

2.  Write a better interpolative decomposition code; perhaps we should
also not explicitly store the identity matrix in R and exploit the its
presence in the jacobi_transform code.
